# zpy_animation_wait_for_input
 In SFM, you can record animation, dragging things around, like you can in Blender.  
 However, what you do there is click the record button then it waits for you to start moving the thing you want to animate.  
 This does that for Blender.  This also provides a method to disable looping playback.
